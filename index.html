                    <h2>Communications and Marketing Coordinator<br>(and Student)</h2>

                    <p>Hi there! My name is Karla and I just started my first full-time job after graduating in May 2022. However, I love to learn and have always wanted to learn how to code so here I am: taking more classes and back at school. </p>
                    <!-- e.g. I love building websites, and learning to code! -->
                    <p>I love spending time in nature and enjoying the beautiful Southern California weather. </p>
                    <!-- e.g. I spent my weekends in the mountains hiking with my friends. -->

                        <h3>Healthy Campus Survey</h3>
                        <p>The Healthy Campus Survey was launched in Fall 2022 to gather baseline data for USC faculty and staff on their perceptions of campus environment. I helped develop a communications strategy for promoting the survey and getting more than 6,000 faculty and staff to complete the survey. Click the link below to see the mailer I helped design and distribute to all USC employees.</p>

                        <h3>MoveWell Campaign</h3>
                        <p>The MoveWell campaign is a page of resources for USC faculty and staff to support more movement and activity at work and support a healthy lifestyle. I helped compile the resources, gather photos, and build the webpage on our center's WordPress site. I also worked on the communications and marketing strategy for getting the word out.</p>

                        <h3>Health & Well-being Resource Directory</h3>
                        <p>The Health & Well-being Resource Directory is a document of resources available to USC faculty and staff to support them in all aspects of wellness (along 8 domains of well-being). In this project, I helped compile some of the resources and designed the document with Adobe InDesign. After that, I worked on materials to promote the guide, post it on the website, and plug it on social channels.</p>
